* chat-demo
A very simple chat demo that uses websockets.
[[https://github.com/rvirding][Robert]] used it in a QCon presentation.
It uses [[https://github.com/knutin/elli][elli]] and JQuery.

** Building
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ rebar3 release
#+END_SRC
or
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ rebar3 as prod release
#+END_SRC
or just
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ rebar3 compile
#+END_SRC

** Usage
Start a =chat_demo= release with an Erlang shell:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ./_build/{default,prod}/rel/chat_demo/bin/chat_demo console
#+END_SRC

If you've already compiled =chat_demo=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lfe
> (chat-demo:start)
ok
#+END_SRC
or
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
lfe -s chat-demo
#+END_SRC

You can then access the chat system from the browser by going to port 8080 on
the current machine.

NOTE: the browser front-end is severely lacking and needs much work.
